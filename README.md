# Polygon-maker
This code can be used to Draw any kind of polygon after giving its x and y coordinates as input and do operations on it like Scaling, Translation, Rotation.
Same you can do with disc
Input Format:
#for polygon
polygon
0 1 1 0 #initial x-coordinates
0 0 1 1 #initial y-coordinates
#S for scaling
#T for translation
#R for rotation
S 2 1
R 45
T 1 1
#keep on writing operations
#when you are done type quit
quit

#for disc
disc
0 1 5#initial x and y-coordinates of centre and radius

#S for scaling
#T for translation
#R for rotation
S 2 1
R 45
T 1 1
#keep on writing operations
#when you are done type quit
quit
